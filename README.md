Updated version of a hackathon project that I worked on with github.com/jimmyjiji at Unhackathon 2015.

The Scenify extension allows a person to swap images, insert text, and autoplay music upon opening a new tab. Using the options menu, you can change what images, text, and music are being inserted into a page.
The default options are set to images of John Cena, John Cena quotes, and his WWE intro song, referencing the John Cena meme.
